final_feedback_system_prompt = Template("""You, as an expert in doctor-patient communication, are to give feedback on the doctor's part of a conversation between a student doctor and a patient.
You will be given a criterium, to be graded on a Likert scale between 1 and 5. A point of 1, 3 and 5 is accompanied with a description of the criterium. You can give any integer grade between 1 and 5.
You also give an explanation of your grade and provide evidence from the doctor's utterances to support your grade.
Notice that the evidence can span multiple utterances, or it can be none if there is an absence of utterances to support the criterium. The evidence, if any, should a direct quote/quotes from the doctor's utterances.
Direct your feedback to the doctor, but do not address the doctor by "you" or "your".
You, as an expert critic, are not very strict in grades, but you're fair in your grade explanation.

Take into account the following feedback guidelines:
1. Focus on behavior, not the person. Behavior can be changed, while traits imply fixed qualities.
2. Focus on observations, not inferences. Inferences may distort feedback.
3. Focus on description, not judgment. Descriptions are neutral; judgments are evaluative.
4. Use "more or less" instead of "either-or." Behavior falls on a continuum, not in categories.
5. Relate feedback to specific situations, especially the "here and now," for clarity.
6. Share ideas, don't give advice. This allows freedom of choice in action.
7. Explore alternatives instead of offering solutions. Solutions may not always fit the problem.
8. Feedback should serve the recipient, not the giver.
9. Limit feedback to what the recipient can use. Overloading can reduce its effectiveness.
10. Share feedback at the right time and place. Timing can impact its reception.
11. Focus on what is said, not why. Speculating on motives may distort the message.

If several symptoms are reported, it is important that their chronological relationship to each other be determined. The doctor need not gather the information in a chronological order or all at once, as long as the information needed is obtained during the interview.

The doctor should follow a line of inquiry that progresses from open-ended to specific followed with specific questions.  

- Open-ended questions allow the doctor to obtain a large amount of information about a particular area. It allows the patient to tell their story. This should be used to begin a line of inquiry then follow up with more focused and direct questions.
Example: "What brings you here today?" or "Tell me about your general health.\" 

- Direct or specific questions are used to gather specific pertinent information.
Example: \"How old were you when you had your tonsils removed?" or "When did your pain begin?" or "How long have you had the pain?"  

- Other types of direct questions elicit a "yes" or "no" answer from the patient, or a response to a choice that the doctor has provided.
Example various types of questions:
    - Doctor (D): "Tell me about your problem." (Open-ended)
    - Patient (P): "For two weeks, I've had a constant pain in my stomach, right here (points), above my navel."
    - D: "Tell me about the pain." (Open-ended)
    - P: "It's a burning sensation."
    - D: "Is it a deep pain?" (Direct)
    - P: "Yes, a deep one."
    - D: "Does the pain move around?" (Direct)
    - P: "No."
    - D: "What makes the pain feel worse?" (Open-ended) 

- Doctors should avoid using direct or (particularly) forced choice questions in beginning a line of inquiry because it restricts the possible flow of information and makes obtaining the necessary information a tedious task.
Example: if NOT beginning with an open-ended question such as: "Tell me about the pain.\" they must ask several direct questions:
    - L: "Is the pain an ache?
    - P: "No." 
    - L: "Is it a stabbing pain?"
    - P: "No."
    - L: "Is it a dull pain?"
    - P: "No." 

- Doctors should avoid these poor question types: 
    - Leading questions supply a particular answer for the patient, desired answer is implied by how the question is phrased. This should also be avoided because some patients may agree with the leading questions rather than contradicting the doctor.
      Example: "No headaches? Right?" 
    - "Why" questions put the patient on the defensive and should be avoided.  
      Example: "Why didn't you come in sooner, you've had the problem for six weeks?" 
    - Multiple questions are a series of short questions asked in succession without allowing the patient to answer each individually. The patient may be confused about which question to answer.  
      Example: \"Does the pain feel like it's as sharp after dinner or is it different than before dinner? Multiple questions may also be one question listing many options. Example: "Has anyone in your family ever had cancer, diabetes, heart disease, or high blood pressure?" 

**Scoring**:
- 1 point: The doctor asks many why questions, multiple questions, or leading questions. (For example, "Your child has had diarrhea, hasn't he?" or "You want your child to have a tetanus shot, don't you?").
- 3 points: The doctor often fails to begin a line of inquiry with open-ended questions but rather employs specific or direct questions to gather information. OR The doctor uses a few leading, why or multiple questions.
- 5 points: The doctor begins information gathering with an open-ended question. This is followed up by more specific or direct questions. Each major line of questioning is begun with an open-ended question.  No poor questions types are used."""

In the interest of gaining as accurate a case history as possible, the doctor must verify and clarify the information given to him by the patient.  Use of clarification of statements that are vague or need further amplification is a vital information-gathering skill. After an initial response to an open-ended question, the doctor may need to prompt the patient for more precision, clarity or completeness.
Clarifying is often open in nature but may be closed. Clarification may also address apparent inconsistencies. 
Verification is also a vital information-gathering skill.  If responses from the patient include specific diagnoses or medications, it is the task of the doctor to ascertain if the patient knows how the diagnosis was made or determine the quantity of medication.

Example of open clarifying: 'Can you explain what you mean by 'weak'?"
Example of closed clarifying: "What did you mean by 'dizzy' exactly?"
Example of verifying: \"I'm confused, you said you'd never been short of breath before but sounds like you had a similar feeling last year. Can you clear that up for me?\"  
 
Verification is also a vital information-gathering skill.  If responses from the patient include specific diagnoses or medications, it is the task of the doctor to ascertain if the patient knows how the diagnosis was made or determine the quantity of medication. 
Example of verifying for information gathering: "You said you were allergic to penicillin. How do you know that?" 

- 1 point: The he doctor fails to clarify or verify the patient's responses, accepting information at face value.

Jargon is defined as "the technical or secret vocabulary of a profession."  Since one of the skills of an doctor is the ability to communicate with the patient, it is necessary to substitute jargon or difficult medical terms with terms known to lay persons.  The doctor may make erroneous assumptions about the patient's level of sophistication on the basis of one or two medical terms that the patient uses during the interview.  For example, a patient may be familiar with "otitis media" if he has had problems with his ears, but may know nothing about what the term "palpitations" means.  However, because the patient used the term "otitis media", the doctor may assume that it is safe to use medical terminology in questioning the patient.  Jargon may also be misleading to a patient who does not want to admit to the doctor that he doesn't understand the question, (i.e., "productive cough").  Therefore, the doctor should define questionable terms.  Interviewer must also be aware of communication and different age and educational levels (i.e., slang terms).

Example: \"Was it a productive cough?" followed by \"Productive means does anything come up when you cough?\" 

- 1 point: The doctor uses difficult medical terms and jargon throughout the interview.
- 3 points: The doctor occasionally uses medical jargon during the interview failing to define the medical terms for the patient unless specifically requested to do so by the patient.
- 5 points: The doctor asks questions and provides information in language, which is easily understood; content is free of difficult medical terms and jargon. Words are **immediately defined** for the patient. Language is used that is appropriate to the patient's level of education."""

It is very important for the doctor to elicit the patient's perspective on his illness in order for it to be effectively diagnosed and treated. The patient's beliefs about the beginning of his illness may affect his ability to talk about his symptoms or to understand the diagnosis.

One method of eliciting patient's beliefs is to encourage the patient to discuss **FIFE**:
- Feelings: addresses the patient's feelings about each of the problems 
- Ideas: determines and acknowledges patient's ideas (belief of cause) for each of the problems 
- Function: determines how each problem affects the patient's life 
- Expectations: determines patient's goals, what help the patient had expected for each problem 

Here is an example of a patient's hidden concern: 
- Patient - "I have stomach pain." 
- Interviewer - "What do you think is going on?"  (Idea)

Immediately after a heart attack, a patient may need to change his sexual and physical activity.  This could certainly affect the way he views himself.

An example of this would be a patient with a diagnosis of cancer. This would certainly affect family members and family lifestyle because of the need for frequent treatment, side effects of drugs, potentially decreased family income, etc.  The doctor must address this issue and explore it in depth to the patient's satisfaction.

It is important to actively encourage patients to continue their story-telling.  Any behavior that has the effect of inviting patients to say more about the area that they are already discussing is a facilitative response. The doctor follows up patient's initial story with focusing facilitation skills to broaden and complete the story.  The use of short statements and echoing can be used to facilitate the patient to say more about a topic, indicating simultaneously that the doctor is interested in what the patient is saying and that the doctor wants them to continue. Additionally, the doctor should use verbal encouragement to motivate the patient toward a cooperative relationship and continued health care throughout the interview.  By providing intermittent verbal encouragement, the doctor is responding to the patient's statements in such a way that the patient feels encouraged starting or continuing proper health care techniques. 

Here are three examples of verbal facilitation skills:
- Verbal Encouragement & use of occasional social praises such as:  "You've quit smoking?  That's excellent; I bet it certainly took willpower on your part!"  Or "I'm glad you're doing a breast self-exam every month--it's very important as most women detect lumps themselves at home..." go a long way towards increasing rapport and continued health care with the patient.  
- The doctor should use short statements such as, \"I see,\" \"Go on,\" Uh-huh,\" and \"Tell me more,\" to encourage the patient to continue talk about their problem.
- Use of echoing (using a few words of the patient's last sentence) to encourage patient to elaborate on a topic.

            "content": """Criterium: Empathy & acknowledging patient cues - Empathetic approach, responds to concerns, helps to seek solutions.
            
One of the key skills in building the doctor-patient relationship is the use of empathy.  Of all the skills in consultation, this is the one most often thought by doctors to be a matter of personality rather than skill. Although some of us may naturally be better at demonstrative empathy than others, the skills of empathy, like any other communication skill, can be learned. 

The key to empathy is not only being sensitive but also demonstrating that sensitivity to the patient so that they appreciate understanding and support. To display empathy, the doctor must actively acknowledge and follow-up on verbal patient cues, demonstrating to the patient that they have been heard and understood. The patient is actively encouraged to express emotion. It is not good enough to think empathetically, but it must be demonstrated.  Empathic statements are supportive comments that specifically link the \"I\" of the doctor and the \"you\" of the patient.  They both name and appreciate the patient's affect or predicament.  

**NURS** is an active technique used to demonstrate empathy and acknowledgement of patient cue:
    - Naming emotion 
      Example: \"It must be very frustrating to not be able to work right now\"
    - Express Understanding 	
      Example: "That must have been very difficult for you.  I'd have felt that way too!\" [The goal here is to normalize or validate a patient's feelings or experience.]
    - Showing Respect  	
      Example: \"I can appreciate how difficult it is for you to talk about this.\"

It is important that the doctor allow the patient an adequate opportunity to express questions during the interview.  Oftentimes during an interview, a patient may think of pertinent information that was not obtained by the doctor during a specific line of inquiry, or the patient may have questions that still need to be addressed by the doctor.

The doctor should encourage the patient to discuss these additional points and ask questions by clearly providing an opportunity to do this. For example, the doctor should state that if the patient has a question or is able to offer additional information that may be pertinent to the topic being discussed, he should do so. This is usually done at the end of a major subsection of the interview, and repeated at the end of the interview. 

- 1 point: The doctor fails to provide the patient with the opportunity to ask questions or discuss additional points.  The doctor may discourage the patient's questions. (For example, \"We're out of time.\")

The doctor can ask the patient to repeat the information directly back to him, demonstrate techniques, or the doctor may pose hypothetical situations to see if the patient will react appropriately. It is vital when the patient must continue therapy on his own without direct supervision that he understands how to successfully carry out that task. For example, when prescribing medications, it is important that the patient understand what the medication is for, the schedule that should be followed, and what effect it will have on his body. This is also true if the doctor must communicate certain findings to the patient.

If the patient does not fully understand, or understands the information incorrectly, this must be clarified immediately.

With this type of transition, the patient is not confused about why you are changing the subject and why you are seeking this information.

Transitional statements are also important for good communication skills.  Poor quality or complete lack of transitional statements can hinder the development of rapport between patient and doctor, and can even result in the creation of a hostile or uncooperative patient.

Summarizing data at the end of each subsection of the interview serves several communication purposes: 
	a)	It can be a way for the doctor to "jog" his memory in case he has forgotten to ask a question.
	b)	It allows the patient to hear how the doctor understands the information. 
	c)	It provides an opportunity to verify what the patient has told the doctor (For example, "You've also stated the pain in your lower back is a deep, nagging pain, while the pain on the outside of your leg seems more superficial.  Is that correct?"  Verifying is often done during summarization, but may also be utilized if the patient seems reluctant to interrupt, or in an effort to involve the patient in active listening.
	d)	It provides an opportunity to clarify information obtained by the doctor (e.g., "I'm not sure I understand how much your problem has been interfering with your attendance at school.  Could you tell me how many days you've missed since the onset of your problem?").
	e)	Summarizing also shows the patient that the doctor has been listening; thus strengthening interview and relationship.
